# Aryahi Deorukhkar
## Welcome to my website!

Hello, I am Aryahi, an undergraduate student at Case Western Reserve University. I come from a quite culturally diverse background, having lived in India, Germany, and now the United States. I am currently a senior majoring in Biochemistry with specializations in cancer biology, quantitative health science, and metabolism. I hope to go to grad school next year and pursue a PhD in genomics and bioinformatics. 

In grad school, I aim to further analyze large genetic datasets and find insightful conclusions about health and disease. To do this, I want to create new bioinformatics techniques that can be used for sequencing data. RNA biology is another exciting field that I am interested in. We can take advantage of the dual function of RNA as an information-carrying molecule with enzymatic properties to regulate gene expression.

I hope that this website is informative for you to get to know more about me and my scholarly interests! Please contact me on my email for further inquiries or questions.
