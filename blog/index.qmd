title: "Blog: Dashboard for Systolic Blood Pressure is Launched"
---

Hello everyone,


Iâ€™m excited to share my newly launched dashboard, which explores changes in systolic blood pressure. Built using Quarto and hosted on GitHub, the dashboard integrates statistical analyses that investigate the relationship between systolic blood pressure and various factors. I chose systolic blood pressure as the focal point because it represents the force exerted on blood vessels when the heart contracts. Biologically, this is a fascinating measure of cardiovascular health. The data used in this analysis comes from the NHANES dataset, produced by the CDC, and focuses on adults aged 21 to 79 during the pre-pandemic years of 2017 to 2020.
The first analysis examines whether systolic blood pressure decreases with repeated measurements. This question was inspired by my experience volunteering in urgent care, where nurses often retook blood pressure readings after a brief rest to address elevated initial measurements caused by nervousness or physical activity. Using paired t-tests, the results showed a statistically significant but small decrease (90% confidence interval: 0.1 to 0.3 mmHg) between the first and third readings. However, this change is biologically irrelevant, as it falls below the resolution of most oscillometric devices. While retaking measurements slightly reduces systolic blood pressure, the effect is negligible. Future research could explore how posture (sitting vs. lying down) might influence these readings.


The second analysis investigates whether systolic blood pressure differs between males and females. Observing that males generally have higher blood pressure in clinical settings, I used bootstrapping to compute a 90% confidence interval (4.9 to 6.4 mmHg) for the difference. The results confirm that males tend to have significantly higher systolic blood pressure than females. These findings align with existing knowledge, suggesting biological sex differences likely contribute to this disparity. Future studies could examine factors like lifestyle, age, or genetics to understand this trend further.


The third analysis explores racial and ethnic disparities in systolic blood pressure. Using Welch's ANOVA and Tukey HSD post-hoc tests, I found significant differences among racial groups, with Non-Hispanic Black adults exhibiting consistently higher systolic blood pressure compared to others. The most pronounced differences were observed between Non-Hispanic Black adults and both Non-Hispanic Asians and Mexican Americans. These findings warrant further investigation into the interplay of genetic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors contributing to such disparities.


Finally, the last analysis examines the relationship between obesity and hypertension. Using a 2x2 contingency table, the results showed that obese individuals are 48.5% more likely to develop hypertension than non-obese individuals (relative risk: 1.485, 90% CI: [1.421, 1.552]). The odds of hypertension were also significantly higher in obese adults (odds ratio: 2.07, 90% CI: [1.906, 2.248]), with an absolute risk difference of 17.85%. These results strongly suggest that obesity is a significant risk factor for hypertension. Future research could explore socioeconomic or educational variables to understand their potential role as confounders.
I hope this dashboard and its findings provide valuable insights and spark curiosity about the factors influencing systolic blood pressure. Thank you for exploring my work, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!
