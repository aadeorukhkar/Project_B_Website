# Published Dashboard to Analyze BMI Distributions
## Sunday, December 15th

I published a dashboard on this website that allows users to explore the distribution of BMI across a range of factors. These factors include lifestyle variables, such as physical activity levels, biological factors like age and sex, and socioeconomic factors, such as poverty status or whether someone receives emergency food assistance. I was inspired to analyze BMI due to the ongoing discussions about the obesity epidemic and I wanted to investigate which factors truly impact BMI in the United States. The data for this analysis came from the CDC's NHANES dataset for all observations from 2017 to 2020 (pre-pandemic). By analyzing a combination of lifestyle, biological, and socioeconomic factors, I aimed to uncover whether variables commonly discussed in public health—like physical activity—are as significant as other less frequently addressed aspects, like access to food or socioeconomic status. The dashboard offers an interactive tool to explore these relationships for users.

Building the dashboard was a new and challenging, but ultimately rewarding. I used R to set up the website framework and integrated a Shiny app to perform the data analysis. I initially attempted to clean the data directly within the app, but I quickly realized this made the dashboard unnecessarily complicated. By separating the data cleaning process into an external file, I was able to keep the dashboard simple and efficient. This approach not only streamlined the user interface but also allowed me to focus on the analysis itself without getting bogged down by the complexities of data manipulation in real-time. Importing the cleaned data ensured that the dashboard would run smoothly and enabled me to present users with a clearer, more focused interface.

First, I wanted to show the importance of log transformation in the analysis of BMI on my dashboard. The log transformation was necessary to meet the assumptions of linear regression, specifically to ensure normality of the outcome variable. To make this clear to users, I included visualizations such as histograms, violin plots, and Q-Q plots to show the distribution of BMI both before and after the transformation. These visualizations allowed users to directly observe how the log transformation improved the data distribution and made it more suitable for regression analysis. Additionally, I gave users the option to use either complete or imputed data. The original dataset contained 2,847 observations, but imputing missing data brought the total to 3,129 observations. Interestingly, both methods yielded identical results for the linear regression analysis, reinforcing the idea that while imputation may help retain more data, it did not significantly alter the conclusions drawn from the analysis. This feature also allowed users to explore the impact of missing data on the analysis.

One of the goals of the dashboard was to help users explore the relationships between individual variables and BMI. For quantitative predictors, such as age or physical activity, I used scatterplots to visualize the linear relationships with BMI. For categorical predictors, like biological sex or emergency food assistance, I used violin plots, which provide a clearer picture of how BMI is distributed across different categories. These visualizations enabled users to understand how each variable contributes to the overall BMI distribution, and how the linear regression model accounted for these factors. By allowing users to interact with the data and see the effects of each variable in isolation, I aimed to make the analysis more accessible and intuitive. These visualizations helped contextualize the statistical model and allowed users to form a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing BMI.

The results of the analysis were both surprising and insightful. Socioeconomic status, emergency food assistance, and biological sex were found to be the largest predictors of BMI. This was unexpected because, based on common assumptions, lifestyle factors like physical activity levels or exercise recommendations would likely be seen as more directly related to BMI. Additionally, one might expect age to play a larger role in determining physical activity levels and, by extension, BMI. However, the analysis revealed that socioeconomic status, particularly access to food, plays a more significant role in determining BMI than lifestyle factors such as exercise. This finding challenges the conventional wisdom that exercise and diet are the primary determinants of BMI. The results suggest that broader social factors, such as income and food security, have a much larger impact on BMI than previously assumed. Furthermore, the analysis highlighted the role of biological sex in shaping metabolism and BMI, which adds another layer of complexity to the understanding of BMI. These findings underscore the importance of considering socioeconomic and biological factors when addressing public health issues related to BMI and obesity.
